# Basic start up

## Starting point

The detailed git setup instructions must have been followed.

-   a github repository `learning_R` has been made in your account
-   the github repository has been cloned locally on your PC

Now we will learn how to use **git in Rstudio to backup your code to the
cloud server: github**. Git version control system can be used for much
more. But learning how to backup your data on the cloud is enough for a
starter.

## Create/Open a project in Rstudio

External resource: see also [Project Management with
RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro.html)

1.  Open Rstudio
2.  Browse to the directory where you cloned the `learning_R`git
    repository:

-   [ ]   create : `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory`

Note: after to re-open the project you will need to do:

-   [ ]   open :
    `File -> Open Project -> chose the file with extension .Rproj`

## Git used to backup notes and code via Rstudio

```{r}
DiagrammeR::mermaid(
  "graph TB
      A[R project directory] --git add--> B[Staging area: preparation]
      B --git commit --> C[Local Repository : version control locally on PC] 
      C --push --> D[copy code to remote Repository : github]
      D --pull --> A
  ")
```

<u>Fig. A simple workflow to backup your code and notes to github cloud
server</u>

<!-- make files ? or change order -->

In the git tab in one of the Rstudio panel:

The status (`git status`) allows you to check if files have been
modified, if they are under-version control (tracked) or not.

-   yellow `?` the file is not tracked = not currently version
    controlled and not ignored
-   red `D` deleted, the file has been deleted (or renamed outside of
    git)
-   rosa `R`renamed, the file has been renamed
-   blue `M` the file has been modified

Staging the files means preparing the files for saving them in the
version in the version control system

-   You can stage one or several files.

\- It is usually best to only stage several files when there is a
logical block of work that has been done.

\- you select (checked box) the file(s) to stage and then you can
commit.

You need to write a commit message that explains what you have done
since your previous commit.

> Example: "Summary statistics for AMR detection in E.coli added."

This create a "saving" point in your version control system,

-   Then you need to push: this sends the changes to the remote
    repository (github / cloud)

It is important to do this process often, because you create saving
points, where you can go back, should you for some reason loose your
code on your PC. Each time you commit, the commit message and the status
of your files are registered in the version control system. A log in git
system (you can look at it on github) can help you find back the files
at the saving point you want.

If you work on different computer, or with different people, you might
need to pull changes. Pull takes the changes from the cloud repository
(github) and put them in the local repository. Note that we likely wont
have time to do this during this course, but it is good to know that its
possible to do so if needed.
<!-- we wont explain this specifically for now -->

> You can learn how to do that using the [git for novice
> lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

## Exercise to learn how to use git in R studio: modify `.gitignore` and push the changes to github

> Note:
>
> -   we wont version control raw and intermediary data, because we do
>     not want them to finish in the public directory (among other
>     things).
> -   Raw data need to be backed-up on their own.
> -   The raw data should NEVER be modified manually.
> -   It should be possible to recover the processed data (eg. outlier
>     removed, quality ensured) using code for pre-processing the raw
>     data. Therefore processed data should be recoverable by solely
>     re-running the pre-processing code.
> -   Both the pre-processing code and the code that is further used for
>     your analyses should be version controlled.

**Modify or create `.gitignore` file in your project directory.**

A `.gitignore` file is a file that tells git what files the version
control system should ignore (eg. any files that contains raw data).

-   [ ]  Verify that those lines are present in the \`.gitignore file,
    if not, add them

``` text
**/.*xlsx
**/.*csv
data/
results/
**.Rprofile
**.Rhistory
**.Rproj
**.sqlite
```

-   [ ]  add .gitignore to the staging area
-   [ ]  commit the changes with a commit message
-   [ ]  push the changes to github
-   [ ]  verify in your github account that the changes are have been
    recorded

You will now be able to version control your code code and notes. If you
do not want a file to be tracked, you need to add its path (relative to
the path in the git repository) to the `.gitigore` file.

You can look at [the ignoring things
lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore.html) to go
further on how to ignore files.

# Using a notebook in Rstudio: anatomy, text, code and rendering

A Notebook (here Rmarkdown) is a way to write code and text (notes,
publications, reports) in the same document.

The text can be easily formatted using the "Markdown syntax". See Those
lesson to learn about [Markdown
syntax](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/R-markdown/03-headings-lists/index.html).
For now, it will be sufficient to use this
[cheatcheat](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), have it open
in a web-browser and use it !

A rendering (knit button) of the document allows to create different
types of documents (html, pdf, word, slides).

<!-- This is what we have done to create this course. -->

Create a Rmarkdown document :

-   [ ]  Open a new Rmarkdown document: `File -> New File -> Rmarkdown`

-   [ ]  fill tile information, keep as html (`output: word_document`
    can be used as alternative to create word documents).

-   [ ]  save this file (or your project) your current R project

    directory, in a sub-directory called notes (as you will use it to
    take notes during this course) choose eg, `date_learningR.Rmd` as
    file name. ISO date is eg. 2024-10-09. **! Do not use spaces in the
    file name, use underscore `_` instead.**

-   [ ]  Read what the text that appears in the document.

> NB: code directory can be done at saving time, using right click on
> the mouse then new directory and write: notes

<!-- explain the text -->

![Fig: Anatomy of a R markdown
document](https://nkaza.github.io/intro2Rbook/images/rm_components.png)
</br>

## Exercise Using a R markdown document

¨ Here is what we will now do:

-   [ ]   Take notes in your document of what the different parts of a
    Rmarkdown file are doing (ask us to repeat as many times as
    necessary and help if you do not know where to start with)
-   [ ]  Experience with Source vs Visual mode on top of your markdown
    document
-   [ ]  Experience with some markdown formatting
-   [ ]  write the code bellow in a code chunk (cell) and and run it
    (green arrow) <!-- Explain code -->
-   [ ]  Knit the document to see how it can create a document from your
    notes

PS: - Note the importance of formatting in YALM header - We wrote the
tutorial for the course using Markdown - you can download the Rmd
document (top right of the html file under code), and look at the code
of this file in Rstudio to see how it was done.

We will do a series of small exercises to get you familiar with Rstudio
and how code is written in R. **It is important than you stop us if you
do not understand what the code is doing**
<!-- Explain all the steps of the code -->

```{r first object, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
my_message <- "Hello World"
print(my_message)
```

<!-- Some other way with code -->

```{r  echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
my_message
typeof(my_message)
str(my_message)
```

-   [ ]  Run one line of code at in a cell (`ctrl+Enter` cursor at the
    end of the line, look at the results in Rstudio console)
-   [ ]  Check what does my_message object contains
-   [ ]  Check the type of my_message what is its abbreviation ?
-   [ ]  Check the structure of my_message object\
-   [ ]  Access the help (cursor + F1 on the function) : read in the
    help tab (find the correct panel) window
-   [ ]  run the whole cell. What is the difference of running line by
    line than running the whole cell ?

See also [Help in R
studio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/03-seeking-help.html)

```{r  echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,  class.source = "fold-show"}
length(my_message)
nchar(my_message)

nb_char <- nchar(my_message)
nb_char
nb_char + 10
nb_char * nchar(my_message)
```

-   [ ]  we can reuse objects from cell to cell in the same notebook
-   [ ]  vector of length one VS number of characters of a string ....
    (be sure to always check if your results make sense according to
    what you expect !)

Bellow we show you a small introduction to: - **assignment** of
**objects** in R - **types** of **objects** in R - **character**
**vectors** - **lists** and **sub-setting** of list using **indexes** -
R numbering stats at 1.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
strsplit(my_message, split = "")

split_test <- strsplit(my_message, split = "") 
split_test
typeof(split_test)

split_test[1]
split_test[[1]]
split_test[[1]][1]
split_test[[1]][1:3]
```

-   transforming a string into a list of characters (**types
    conversion**)
-   **reassignment** of objects: replacement in memory

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,  class.source = "fold-show"}
unlist(split_test)
split_test <-unlist(split_test)
split_test

split_test[1]
typeof(split_test)
length(split_test)
```

-   manipulations with **functions** that allows to transform objects
-   several **operations** are possible one after another

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,  class.source = "fold-show"}
3*3+1
(3*3)+1

(3*(3+1))
```

-   brackets priority in maths is respected (mathematics).

> Important to note the difference between a list and a vector.

## Tricks

Some tricks to make your life easier. 

- [ ]  using arrow(s) to recall the last result(s) in console 
- [ ]   using tab to auto complete
the name of the object 
- [ ]   `ctrl+L` (or the broom) to clear the
console

> Do not worry, if this goes fast. We will come back to that during the
> course. During the course you will have to pay attention to the
> key-words in bold, and figure out what they mean. Those words are
> usefull when you need to find on the web how you should do things
> further.

<mark><b>What you have to retain from here is that you need to have
critical sense and check your results, to be sure the code is doing what
we want it to do</b></mark>

## Do not forget

-   [ ]  please check that you saved your notes and do all the required
    steps to push those on github.

# Installing packages

Packages are a way to extend the functionality of R.

```{r install packages, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
# A comment
# Another way to get help on a function
?install.packages
help("install.packages")
# F1 on : install.packages()
```

-   we can install here. It is a simple package that will allow
    reference to files in the project by their path in an easy way. It
    allow is great to have compatibility between linux and windows based
    systems.

```{r install here, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
# installing here package
install.packages("here", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Library is a function that allows you to load (into memory), and make
the functions contained a package available to you, in the current R
session. <!-- Explain Rsession -->

<u>The function here() gives the path of the project</u>

```{r load here, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
# loading the package
library(here)
here()
```

NB: You can also install packages using Rstudio (BUT its better to keep
a trace of what you have installed), so please do that using code.

You can call functions from packages that are not loaded to memory if
they are installed on your system. This can be convenient if you only
want to use one function, this avoids cluttering the memory of your
computer.

Calling functions while specifying the package can be useful also, if
you have loaded some packages that have functions with the same name. It
is generally a good practice to do so (but takes time to do so .... )
<!-- recommends to do so when we are happy of what our code does  -->

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
here::here()
```

## Packages and different ways to do the same thing

There are many packages in R, and there are usually many ways to do the
same thing, some functions share also some similarities

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
library(dplyr)

# both functions allow to have a look at the structure of your data
glimpse(my_message) 
dplyr::glimpse(my_message) 

str(my_message)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
library(stringr)

# both functions allow to split a string
str_split_1(my_message, pattern = "")
#stringr::str_split(my_message, pattern = "")

unlist(strsplit(my_message, split = ""))
#base::unlist(base::strsplit(my_message, split = ""))
```

-   [ ]  can you find which package glimpse, unlist, str functions are
    from ?
-   [ ]  how can you find this information ?
-   [ ]  reading the help
-   [ ]  imports (glimpse vs pkg::glimpse)

## Functions are objects

In packages, functions functions that do complex things, are often build
using several simpler functions.

Here we show that there are several ways to obtain the same results.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
my_strsplit1 <- function(char_var){
  temp <- strsplit(char_var, split = "")
  return(unlist(temp))
}

my_strsplit1(my_message)
```

Different way to write : (explain)

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
# return is factlatif if an oject is returned at creation
my_strsplit2 <- function(char_var){
  unlist(
    strsplit(char_var, split = "")
    )
}
my_strsplit2(my_message)

```

Using Pipes ...

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
my_strsplit3 <- function(char_var){
  # R pipe  
  strsplit(char_var, split = "") |>
    unlist()
  # importance ()
}

my_strsplit3(my_message)
```

[magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) which is part of the
tidyverse multiverse (a collection of packages that work well together)
offers another type of pipe, which is the one that you will see most
commonly used.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
my_strsplit4 <- function(char_var){
  # R pipe  
  strsplit(char_var, split = "") %>%
    unlist
  # with %>% () can be omitted (though not advised)
}

my_strsplit4(my_message)
```

<u>What you need to retain from here is:</u>

-   there are different ways to do the same tings. R syntax is flexible
    and not always homogeneous. Do not learn a syntax

-   understand a syntax, check in the help when in doubt

-   there are several ways to obtain the result you want. While some are
    prettier or more efficient from other, the most important is that it
    does what you want it to do.
    
## Do not forget

-   [ ]  save, push your notes on github, and close your notes and
    project.

-   [ ]  Ask questions if you do not know what to answer to questions
    Rstudio might ask


## Exercise: Printing your code in a word document

-   [ ]   Install `webshot2` package
-   [ ]   write the code to load the `webshot2` package into R memory
-   [ ]   change the output format of the Rmarkdown document you are
    using and which contains your notes? (in the YAML header) to
    `word_document` and press `Knit` button. Was a word document
    produced ? (note that indentations have meaning)

unhide by clicking on the `Code` button for hints:

```{r solution exercise: Printing your code in a word document , eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Installing the package
install.packages("webshot2", dependencies = TRUE)

# Modifying the YALM header
output: 
  word_document

# Load the library at the beginning of your script, in a cell
library(webshot2)
```

# Summary

-   This was a lot for today. You got a first overview of what can be
    done and why it can be worth to use this system, ultimately, this
    will help you being more efficient and do reproducible research.

-   Now we will actually use some of those things and repeat them a lot
    to do data analysis,.

# When you are ready to go further

With Git (lessons) :

-   [Git novice lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/),
    learn you how to use the command line in a terminal with git, how to
    use version control to recover lost data or recover for changes that
    made your code not working, and introduces you on how to use of the
    github remote repository using the graphical interface.
